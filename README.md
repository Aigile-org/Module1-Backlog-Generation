# Module 1: User Story and Acceptance Criteria Generation

## 4.3. Module 1

### 4.3.1. Functional Description

Module 1 is the cornerstone of the Aigile project, specifically designed to revolutionize the user story creation process in Scrum-based software development. This module serves as an intelligent automation system that transforms high-level project requirements written in natural language into structured, actionable user stories complete with detailed descriptions, priority rankings, and comprehensive acceptance criteria.

The module addresses one of the most time-consuming and critical phases of agile development: the conversion of business requirements into well-defined user stories that development teams can understand and implement. Traditional manual creation of user stories often takes days or weeks and requires extensive collaboration between product owners, business analysts, and development teams. Module 1 reduces this process to minutes while ensuring consistency, completeness, and adherence to agile best practices.

#### Main Functions:

**1. Intelligent User Story Generation**

The primary function of Module 1 is to automatically generate comprehensive user stories from project requirements. This process involves several sophisticated steps:

- **Natural Language Processing**: The module accepts project requirements written in plain English, eliminating the need for technical specifications or formal documentation formats
- **Contextual Analysis**: Advanced AI algorithms analyze the requirements to understand the project scope, identify key features, and recognize user personas
- **Story Structure Creation**: Each generated user story follows the standard agile format: "As a [user type], I want [functionality] so that [benefit]"
- **Content Generation**: The system creates detailed descriptions that include implementation hints, edge cases, and technical considerations
- **Automatic Formatting**: All stories are formatted according to industry standards and best practices

Each generated user story contains the following structured elements:
  - **Title (Summary)**: A concise, descriptive heading that captures the essence of the story
  - **User Story Statement**: The core functionality described in standard agile format
  - **Detailed Description**: Comprehensive explanation including context, rationale, and implementation notes
  - **Priority Level**: Automatically assigned ranking (Highest, High, Medium, Low, Lowest) based on business value analysis
  - **Unique Story Number**: Permanent identifier that never changes throughout the development lifecycle
  - **Estimated Complexity**: Initial assessment of development effort required
  - **Dependencies**: Identification of related stories or prerequisites

**2. Comprehensive Acceptance Criteria Generation**

For each user story, the module automatically generates detailed acceptance criteria that define the specific conditions that must be met for the story to be considered complete:

- **Behavioral Specifications**: Clear descriptions of expected system behavior under various conditions
- **Input/Output Definitions**: Specific requirements for data handling, user interactions, and system responses
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Identification and specification of boundary conditions and error scenarios
- **Performance Requirements**: Where applicable, inclusion of response time, load, and scalability expectations
- **Validation Rules**: Specific criteria for testing and verification
- **User Interface Requirements**: Detailed specifications for user experience elements

Each acceptance criterion is structured as:
  - **Testable Statements**: Written in "Given-When-Then" format for clarity
  - **Completion Tracking**: Individual criteria can be marked as completed or incomplete
  - **Priority Ordering**: Criteria are arranged by importance and logical implementation sequence
  - **Cross-Reference Links**: Connections to related stories and dependencies

**3. Advanced Priority Assignment System**

The module employs a sophisticated priority ranking system based on the dollar allocation methodology:

### 4.3.4. Other Description of Module 1

#### Advanced Architecture Patterns and Design Decisions:

**1. Job-Based Asynchronous Processing Pattern**

Module 1 implements a sophisticated asynchronous processing architecture specifically designed to handle the unpredictable and potentially long-running nature of AI-powered user story generation. This pattern was chosen to address the fundamental mismatch between user expectations for immediate feedback and the reality of AI processing times.

**Detailed Implementation of Job Processing:**

- **Job Lifecycle Management**:
  - **Initialization Phase**: When a user submits requirements, the system immediately creates a unique job identifier using a combination of timestamp, random string, and user context. This ensures global uniqueness across all concurrent operations.
  - **Queuing and Scheduling**: Jobs are not queued in the traditional sense due to Forge platform limitations. Instead, each job operates independently with its own processing thread.
  - **Execution Monitoring**: Real-time status tracking through persistent storage updates at each processing stage.
  - **Completion Handling**: Comprehensive result processing including validation, formatting, and user notification.
  - **Cleanup and Maintenance**: Automatic removal of job data after 24 hours to prevent storage bloat and ensure privacy compliance.

- **Advanced Status Tracking System**:
  - **Multi-Stage Progress Reporting**: The system reports progress through distinct phases: initialization, AI processing, result validation, priority calculation, and final formatting.
  - **Time Estimation Algorithms**: Dynamic calculation of remaining processing time based on historical data and current system load.
  - **Error State Management**: Sophisticated error classification and recovery strategies that distinguish between temporary network issues, service overload, and permanent failures.
  - **User Communication Strategy**: Real-time updates through WebSocket-like polling with user-friendly messages that explain what's happening at each stage.

**2. Never-Give-Up Polling Strategy**

One of the most innovative aspects of Module 1 is its persistent polling mechanism that continues monitoring job status indefinitely:

- **Infinite Retry Logic**: Unlike traditional systems that give up after a fixed number of attempts, Module 1 continues polling until the job completes or the user explicitly cancels the operation.
- **Adaptive Polling Intervals**: The system starts with frequent polling (every 3 seconds) and can adjust intervals based on estimated completion time and system load.
- **Network Resilience**: Automatic recovery from network failures, service timeouts, and temporary unavailability without losing job context.
- **User Experience Optimization**: Continuous feedback to users showing elapsed time, current status, and assurance that the system is still working.

**3. Intelligent Priority Assignment System**

The priority assignment mechanism in Module 1 represents a significant advancement over traditional manual prioritization:

**Dollar Allocation Methodology Implementation:**

  - Compares all stories against each other
  - Ensures even distribution across the full priority spectrum
  - Maintains stable rankings even when new stories are added
  - Provides transparency in priority assignment logic

- **Mathematical Priority Distribution**: The system uses a mathematical model to distribute priorities evenly:
  ```
  For n stories with ranks 0 to n-1:
  - Rank 0 (highest allocation) → "Highest" priority
  - Rank n-1 (lowest allocation) → "Lowest" priority
  - Ranks 1 to ⌊n/4⌋ → "High" priority
  - Ranks ⌊n/4⌋+1 to ⌊3n/4⌋ → "Medium" priority
  - Ranks ⌊3n/4⌋+1 to n-2 → "Low" priority
  ```

The system uses sophisticated prompt engineering with detailed templates:

```
"You are a helpful assistant tasked with generating unique user stories and grouping them under relevant epics based on any project vision or MVP goal provided.
When generating user stories, ensure they are grouped under relevant epics based on overarching themes, functionalities, or MVP goals identified.
Aim to generate as many stories as necessary to fully cover the scope of the project, with **no upper limit on the number of user stories**."
```

**Key Generation Principles:**
- **Atomic Functionalities**: Each story represents a single, focused capability
- **MVP-Driven**: Stories are generated to support a functional Minimum Viable Product
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: No artificial limits on the number of stories generated
- **Epic Grouping**: Related stories are organized under thematic epics

#### Advanced Parsing and Validation System:

**1. Structured Response Parsing**
```python
def user_story_parser(text_response):
    pattern = re.compile(
        r"### User Story \d+:\n"
        r"- User Story: (.*?)\n" 
        r"- Epic: (.*?)\n"
        r"- Description: (.*?)(?=\n### User Story \d+:|\Z|\n)",
        re.DOTALL
    )
```

This regex-based parser ensures consistent extraction of story components from AI-generated responses, handling multi-line descriptions and maintaining data integrity.

**2. Data Structure Standardization**
Each parsed user story follows a standardized structure:
```javascript
{
    "key": index,
    "user_story": "As a [role], I want [action] so that [benefit]",
    "epic": "Feature grouping theme",
    "description": "Detailed acceptance criteria and implementation notes"
}
```

### Frontend Implementation Details

#### Advanced Validation System:

**1. Comprehensive Input Validation**
```javascript
const validateIssueData = (issueData) => {
  const errors = [];
  
  if (!issueData.summary || issueData.summary.trim().length === 0) {
    errors.push("Summary is required");
  }
  
  if (issueData.summary && issueData.summary.length > 255) {
    errors.push("Summary must be less than 255 characters");
  }
  
  const validPriorities = ["Lowest", "Low", "Medium", "High", "Highest"];
  if (issueData.priority && !validPriorities.includes(issueData.priority)) {
    errors.push("Invalid priority value");
  }
  
  return errors;
};
```

This validation system ensures data integrity before API calls, preventing invalid requests and providing immediate user feedback.

**2. Sophisticated Jira Issue Creation**

The system creates properly structured Jira issues with comprehensive metadata:
```javascript
const requestBody = {
  fields: {
    project: { id: "10000" },
    summary: issueData.summary.trim(),
    description: {
      content: [{
        content: [{ text: issueData.description.trim(), type: "text" }],
        type: "paragraph"
      }],
      type: "doc",
      version: 1
    },
    issuetype: { name: "Story" },
    priority: { name: issueData.priority }
  }
};
```

**3. Enhanced Error Handling and User Communication**
```javascript
if (!response.ok) {
  let errorMessage = `HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`;
  
  try {
    const errorData = await response.json();
    if (errorData.errors) {
      const errorDetails = Object.entries(errorData.errors)
        .map(([field, message]) => `${field}: ${message}`)
        .join(", ");
      errorMessage = `Jira API error: ${errorDetails}`;
    }
  } catch (parseError) {
    console.warn("Could not parse error response:", parseError);
  }
  
  throw new Error(errorMessage);
}
```

This error handling system provides detailed, user-friendly error messages while maintaining system robustness.

### Acceptance Criteria Generation System

#### Dual-Context Processing:

**1. Issue-Specific Context Management**
The acceptance criteria system maintains unique context for each Jira issue:
```javascript
const getIssueSummary = async (issueKey) => {
  const response = await requestJira(`/rest/api/2/issue/${issueKey}`, {
    method: "GET",
    headers: { "Accept": "application/json" }
  });
  
  const issueData = await response.json();
  return { success: true, summary: issueData.fields.summary };
};
```

**2. Advanced Progress Tracking**
The system provides sophisticated progress monitoring for acceptance criteria completion:
```javascript
const getProgress = () => {
  if (ACs.length === 0) return 0;
  const completed = ACs.filter(ac => ac.completed).length;
  return (completed / ACs.length) * 100;
};
```

**3. Intelligent State Management**
The frontend manages complex state across multiple user interactions:
- Real-time progress updates during generation
- Persistent storage of completion status
- Automatic synchronization with backend state
- Error recovery and state consistency

### Advanced Processing Algorithms

#### Dollar Allocation Priority Distribution:

The mathematical model for priority distribution ensures fair and meaningful priority assignment:

```
For n stories with dollar allocations d₁, d₂, ..., dₙ (where Σdᵢ = 100):

Priority Assignment Algorithm:
1. Sort stories by dollar allocation (descending)
2. Assign priorities based on relative position:
   - Top story (highest allocation) → "Highest"
   - Bottom story (lowest allocation) → "Lowest"  
   - Remaining stories distributed evenly across "High", "Medium", "Low"

Distribution Formula:
- Position p in sorted list of n stories
- Priority = f(p, n) where:
  * p = 0 → "Highest"
  * p = n-1 → "Lowest"
  * p ∈ [1, ⌊n/4⌋] → "High"
  * p ∈ [⌊n/4⌋+1, ⌊3n/4⌋] → "Medium"
  * p ∈ [⌊3n/4⌋+1, n-2] → "Low"
```

#### Similarity Filtering for Acceptance Criteria:

The system implements advanced similarity detection to eliminate redundant acceptance criteria:
```python
def filterSimilarAC(acceptance_criterias, ratio=0.85):
    # Removes criteria with similarity above the specified threshold
    # Uses semantic similarity analysis to detect near-duplicates
    # Maintains the most comprehensive version of similar criteria
```

### Quality Assurance Implementation

**1. Product Owner Validation:**
- Focuses on business value and strategic alignment
- Validates completeness of functional behavior
- Ensures stories support overall product vision

**2. Business Analyst Validation:**
- Ensures criteria are specific, measurable, and unambiguous
- Validates business value articulation
- Checks alignment with customer needs

**3. Quality Analyst Validation:**
- Verifies all criteria are testable
- Ensures adequate coverage of failure scenarios
- Validates that testing processes are achievable

**4. Cross-Functional Validation:**

### Performance Optimization Techniques

#### Asynchronous Processing Implementation:

**1. Event Loop Management:**
```python
if sys.platform.startswith("win"):
    asyncio.set_event_loop_policy(asyncio.WindowsSelectorEventLoopPolicy())

loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
```

This ensures optimal async performance across different operating systems.

**2. Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff:**
The system implements sophisticated retry mechanisms for AI service calls:
- Initial retry after 5 seconds
- Exponential increase: 5s → 10s → 15s → 15s → 15s
- Maximum 5 attempts before final failure
- Intelligent error classification for retry decisions

**3. Resource Management:**
- Efficient memory usage within Forge platform constraints
- Automatic cleanup of temporary data after 24 hours
- Optimized polling intervals to balance responsiveness and resource usage

This detailed implementation provides a complete technical foundation that ensures the system is robust, scalable, and maintainable while delivering high-quality user story generation capabilities.
